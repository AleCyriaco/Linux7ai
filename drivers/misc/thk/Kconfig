	help
	  This module provides kernel-side support for the THK LLM Command
	  Assistant. It creates a /dev/thk character device that validates
	  commands against a blocklist, enforces rate limits per UID, and
	  logs all command executions to the kernel audit subsystem.

	  The userspace daemon (thkd) handles LLM inference while this
	  module provides immutable audit logging and security enforcement.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called thk.

	  If unsure, say N.

config THK_AUDIT
	bool "THK audit logging support"

	default y
	help
	  Enable audit logging for all commands validated through /dev/thk.
	  Each validation request is logged via the kernel audit subsystem,
	  providing an immutable record of all THK command activity.

	  If unsure, say Y.
